Description: Graphical tool for managing your PIV-enabled YubiKey
 This tool is used for performing administrative tasks on a PIV-enabled
 YubiKey. It allows management of PIN, PUK, as well as the Management Key,
 and can be used to generate and/or import keys and certificates.
 This is a GUI that wraps yubico-piv-tool, and provides some additional
 functionality.
